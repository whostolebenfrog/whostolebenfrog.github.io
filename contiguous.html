### Largest contiguous array

I was reading a list of popular interview questions: http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~kelu/interviews/questions.html

One of them caught my eye. Actually, at the time of my writing this, I've only made it this far down the list
as I had to stop and try to solve it.

The question is:

"Given an array of positive and negative integers. Find the starting index and length of sub-array with the largest sum. 

Can be done in linear time with constant memory."

It's not a question I've seen before and the answer didn't immediately jump to mind. So how do we go about solving it?

There is a good clue above in that it can be solved in linear time. The means we're likely going to want to be solving in
something like a single pass.

What kind of information can be deduce from what we know?
* sub-arrays have to be contiguous
* the array may include negative numbers as the next number along might more than make up for it. e.g. 3, 2, -2, 7.
  in this case it's worth taking the -2 to gather up the positive 7.
* we need to keep track of the best sum we've found so far as well as some indexes and counts
* if we sum the items in the current sub-array and it comes to less than 0, we know that we've gone too far
* the array contains both positive and negative integers which means that it must have a length and that 
  the final result must be greater than 0

At this point I had an inkling of what the answer would look like;
(1) Loop through the numbers keeping track of the `currentSum` and `maxSum`
(2) if the `currentSum` is positive then keep going
(3) if the `currentSum` is bigger than `maxSum` then update `maxSum`
(4) if the current sum is less than 0 we set it back to 0 and reset
(5) keeping the index and length of the sub-array adds a little book keeping but doesn't change the algorithm

That's not exactly exhaustive but it's enough to start writing some code. The specifics will likely sort themselves
out during the implementation.

I wrote it in Javascript as I had a browser open:

var nums = [-4, 3, 0, -1, -6, 4, 5, -2, 3, -1, 2, -5, 4];
var currentMax = 0;
var currentCount = 0;
var currentStartIndex = 0;
var bestMax = 0;
var bestCount = 0;
var bestStartIndex = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  var n = nums[i];
  currentMax += n;
  if (currentMax > 0) {
    if (currentCount === 0) {
      currentStartIndex = i;
    }
    ++currentCount;
    if (currentMax > bestMax) {
      bestMax = currentMax;
      bestStartIndex = currentStartIndex
      bestCount = currentCount;
    }
  } else {
    currentMax = 0;
    currentCount = 0;
  }
}

The answer ends up in the best* variables.

A fun little question, the fact that we could treat going below 0 as an invalid answer turned out to be key. This meant
we could cleanly reset when this happened.

TODO: how does this look in clojure?
