### why?

On this blog I intend to cover some interesting programming and Clojure topics. Largely this is for my own benefit, I've noticed that my writing has deteriorated in the years since I left university. Mostly it consists of email at work or technical documentation. Both of these formats are actually quite odd may even be exasperating the problem.

I have some ideas of topics that I want to cover. In particular I would like to write some articles on how to develop and structure Clojure code. I would also like to relay some of my experiences working as a programmer at MixRadio.

### who?

My name is Benjamin Griffiths, I work as a programmer on the api at MixRadio where we provide internet streaming music. I work mainly with, and am extremely fond of, Clojure after we transitioned from being a mostly Java shop a few years ago. I've been programming since I started typing basic into my Amstrad something like 22 years ago. These days I'm particularly fond of solving ops problems and making our tooling and deployments as nice as possible.
