`This talk was originally hosted on dev.mixrad.io. Following the demise of MixRadio this is re-hosted here as an archive.`

Here is a selection of talks given by some of the engineers at MixRadio. Some of these talks were filmed when we were a part of Nokia so may refer to us as Nokia Entertainment.

## Herding cattle with Clojure at MixRadio -- <a href="https://twitter.com/neilprosser">Neil Prosser</a>

<div class="heading-info">Clojure eXchange Dec 2014, London</div>

<br>

At MixRadio we use Clojure to power our micro-service architecture and loved it so much we used it to build our AWS deployment tooling.

We'll give you a quick overview of our architecture and introduce you to our newly open-sourced deployment tooling; explaining the problems we faced and how we solved them. Expect code and a live deployment to our production environment.

## Super charging cyanite -- <a href="https://twitter.com/tcoupland">Tom Coupland</a>

<div class="heading-info">Clojure eXchange Dec 2014, London</div>

<br>

Join me for a rapid journey through making metrics move rapidly. The medium in question for these metrics being Cyanite, an open source Clojure project that replaces Graphites default storage engine, Carbon, with a combination of Cassandra and ElasticSearch. We’ll look at the overall data flow, before looking at how it got dialled up to 11 using Clojure’s core.async, custom channels, changing database clients and modifying libraries to suit our needs. Expect code, graphs, words and, in the end, lots of metrics!

## The Story of Bringing Nokia Music from Windows Phone to Windows 8 -- <a href="https://twitter.com/mcooperg">Matt Cooper</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/benbtg">Ben Buttigieg</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/craigpugsley">Craig Pugsley</a>

<div class="heading-info">Build June 2013, San Francisco</div>

<br>

This session will tell the story of how we brought Nokia Music's Windows Phone app to the Windows 8 platform. Matt Cooper (senior architect at Nokia Music) will talk through the evolution of the application architecture from Windows Phone 7 to 8 through to the Windows 8 platform. Ben Buttigieg (senior software engineer for Nokia Music) will discuss some specific technical challenges and solutions in developing the Windows 8 app. Craig Pugsley (principle designer for Nokia Music) will provide practical grounded advice on porting Windows Phone user experiences across to Windows 8, using Nokia Music as a case study.

## Nokia Music Windows Phone 8 App-to-App APIs -- <a href="https://twitter.com/sr_gb">Steve Robbins</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mcooperg">Matt Cooper</a>

<div class="heading-info">Build November 2012, Redmond</div>

<br>

Join us as we explore Nokia Music’s new app-to-app APIs. In this session we’ll explain the new app-to-app feature in Windows Phone 8, how to code for Nokia Music app-to-app APIs and show real-world examples. During this talk we’ll show developers how to use Nokia Music in order to get music content into their apps. We’ll deep-dive into code samples using these new Nokia Music APIs, discuss the design decisions behind them and help you code for them as part of your apps. We’ll also have a few Nokia developer announcements during the talk.

## Six months of MongoDB at Nokia Bristol --  <a href="https://twitter.com/tcoupland">Tom Coupland</a>

<div class="heading-info">MongoDB London June 2012, London</div>

<br>

A look at how a small group of self-motivated developers went about introducing, first themselves, and then their organisation to MongoDB. What made them do it? How did they gain acceptance for a new storage system amongst their peers, administrators and development managers? What was it like to actually write code around MongoDB? Join us for the answers and get the inside story of an adoption mere months old.
